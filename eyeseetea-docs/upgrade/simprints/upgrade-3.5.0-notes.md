# Simprints upgrade 3.5.0 notes

Use this file as the temporary working notes for the Simprints upgrade to 3.5.0.

## Purpose

This file is for:
- temporary upgrade progress
- conflict decisions taken during the current upgrade
- unresolved questions
- follow-up checks before closing the upgrade

This file is not for:
- stable merge rules
- final customization inventory
- long-term functional documentation

## Header

- Client: `simprints`
- Target version: `3.5.0`
- Base branch: `develop-eyeseetea`
- Base commit at previous upgrade close: `f87bec8c3` (3.4.2; fork closed at `develop-simprints@09cad0d3e`, PR #341)
- `develop-eyeseetea` current head: `89b2f2e3b` (Oslo 3.5.0 via PR #343, plus docs commits `3cd19be2e` and `8e0200bcc`)
- Oslo range: `origin/upstream/3.4.2..origin/upstream/3.5.0` (164 commits)
- Upgrade branch: `feature-simprints/upgrade_3.5.0`
- Plan: `openspec/changes/upgrade-to-3-5-0/`
- Started on: `2026-10-22`
- Status: `in_progress`

Previous upgrade (3.4.2) closed and archived on `2026-09-17`. See
`upgrade-3.4.2-notes.md` (kept as a historical record) and
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-17-upgrade-to-3-4-2/`.

`origin/develop-simprints` has no commits ahead of `09cad0d3e` (checked
2026-10-22), so no parallel fork work needs merging after this upgrade.

## Inherited context from the 3.4.2 upgrade: carry into this one

Each item was checked against `develop-eyeseetea@89b2f2e3b` before starting
this merge.

| Item | Status at 3.4.2 close | Verified now | Action for 3.5.0 |
|------|------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| B2: "Feat commits" section in `customization-files-template.md` | pending | **still pending** (no "Feat commits" in the baseline template) | not blocking; pick it up only if this round touches that template |
| B3: OpenSpec CLI scaffolding bump 1.2.0→1.8.0 | pending | **still pending** (baseline `.claude/skills/openspec-*` still `generatedBy: "1.2.0"`) | expect `AA` conflicts on these files again; resolve `accept_ours`, as in 3.4.1 / 3.4.2 |
| B6: `fieldListChannel` `DROP_OLDEST` race | pending | **still pending** (`FormViewModel.kt:127` still `BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST`) | the Simprints 500ms debounce mitigation in `EnrollmentActivity` must survive; re-verify on device during the `registerLast` validation |
| B7: TDD / small-commit rules in `openspec-config.yaml.template` | applied locally, not promoted | **partially promoted** (`3cd19be2e`): baseline template has the test-first and `Commit:` granularity rules, but not the two test-quality rules (assert on observable behavior; name tests by contract) | keep the fork's `openspec/config.yaml` as is; the remaining 2 rules still need a baseline PR |

Open problems carried over (upgrade-relevant context, not tech debt):
- Simprints still uses the Dagger `LoginComponent` / `LoginModule`
  (`AppComponent.plus(LoginModule)`) to inject `SyncBiometricsConfig` after
  sign-in. Oslo 3.5.0 reworks login heavily (OAuth, offline login lockout,
  session renewal), so this is priority check 4.3 in `tasks.md`. Re-run
  the 3.4.1 restoration check if `AppComponent.java` or `LoginActivity.kt`
  conflict.
- DHIS2 core 2.43 `blockedSearchOperators` / `preferredSearchOperator` watch
  item: **status changed**. Baseline now reads both fields when building
  search parameters
  (`tracker/src/androidMain/.../search/data/SearchParametersRepositoryImpl.kt:233,238`).
  Check during priority checks 4.1 and 4.2 whether this affects the
  biometric search query path (§2.1).
- `connectedSimprintsDebugAndroidTest` is blocked by a Room identity-hash
  mismatch whose root cause was not found in 3.4.2. Retry it once on
  3.5.0 / SDK `1.15.0-eyeseetea-fork-1` (task 8.3).

New context from the baseline 3.5.0 upgrade (PR #343) that applies here:
- Oslo changed its `dhis2` / `dhis2PlayServices` `GranularSyncModule.kt`
  (removed `WorkManagerController`), and git raises no conflict on flavor
  copies. Port the change to `app/src/simprints/` (task 2.2 / 3.1).
- ANDROAPP-7666 is fixed in Oslo 3.5.0. Baseline dropped its
  `// EyeSeeTea fix`.
- Oslo migrated `UserManagerImpl.java` to Kotlin, without `logIn()`.
- AGP 9.0.1 → 9.3.1. Android Studio must be Quail 2+ / Rabbit 1; older IDEs
  fail the Gradle sync.
- Oslo's new `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is disabled at repo level
  (`gh workflow disable ci.yml`). Our CI is `eyeseetea-main.yml` (`app-testing`).

## Progress

- baseline prepared: `yes`, `develop-eyeseetea@89b2f2e3b`
- merge started: `yes` (2026-10-22). `git merge develop-eyeseetea --no-commit`, 14 conflicted paths, uncommitted until conflicts are resolved (user decision)
- easy conflicts resolved: `no`
- manual conflicts pending: `n/a`
- validation started: `no`

## Decisions

| File | Classification | Expected delta | Customization | Status | Notes |
|------|----------------|----------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| `app/src/simprints/java/org/dhis2/utils/granularsync/GranularSyncModule.kt` | accept_ours + port Oslo flavor change | drop `WorkManagerController` import, parameter and argument; then it equals Oslo's `dhis2` flavor copy plus license header and formatting | n/a (flavor copy of `dhis2`) | resolved_manual_merge | not conflicted. Found by diffing `origin/upstream/3.4.2..3.5.0 -- app/src/dhis2 app/src/dhis2PlayServices`. Only flavor file with a Simprints copy that Oslo touched (`dhis2Training/DownloadNewVersion.kt` deletion has no relevance: Simprints keeps its own Play-Services-style copy) |
| `app/src/dhis2Training/java/org/dhis2/utils/granularsync/GranularSyncModule.kt` | accept_theirs (delete) | file removed | n/a | resolved_keep_theirs | `UD`: Oslo deleted it, fork only had a whitespace/indent change from an earlier merge |
| `app/src/main/java/org/dhis2/usescases/searchTrackEntity/SearchTEIViewModel.kt` | manual_reapply_on_theirs | biometric search, mode, age, DOB, TET toggle and duplicate-review hooks reapplied on Oslo's new shape | §2.3, §2.4, §2.5, §2.8, §2.9 | resolved_manual_merge | priority checks 4.1 / 4.2 (custom terminology, search error messages `cf72c54d5`). Resolved by the user: Oslo's `teTypeLabel`/`teTypePluralLabel` replace `teTypeName`, plus `teType`, `sequentialSearch`, the `onSearch()` block and the `AttributeSearch` conditions. Fixed a duplicated `-> {` |
| `app/src/main/java/org/dhis2/usescases/searchTrackEntity/SearchTeiViewModelFactory.kt` | manual_reapply_on_theirs | extra constructor dependencies for the Simprints view model | §2.8 | resolved_manual_merge. Oslo only reindented `) :` and added `@Suppress`. Kept our 2 commented params; the diff equals the fork's previous drift |
| `app/src/main/java/org/dhis2/usescases/searchTrackEntity/listView/SearchTEList.kt` | manual_reapply_on_theirs | TET toggle and duplicate-review UI hooks | §2.8, §2.9 | resolved_manual_merge. Resolved by the user: `teTypeName` → `teTypeLabel`, sequential-search blocks kept. Restored the `isLoaded == true` guard (fork commit `1013288a4`, "Avoid crashes") that had been dropped |
| `app/src/main/java/org/dhis2/usescases/teiDashboard/dashboardfragments/teidata/TEIDataFragment.kt` | manual_reapply_on_theirs | biometrics UI surfaces / age threshold on the TEI data screen | §2.4, §2.10 | resolved_manual_merge | also carries the "avoid calls to database in recompositions" fork fix (§5). Imports: both of ours plus Oslo's `CustomLabelContext`. Args: Oslo's formatting plus `lastBiometricsSessionID` |
| `app/src/main/java/org/dhis2/usescases/teiDashboard/DashboardViewModel.kt` | manual_reapply_on_theirs | `_teiCanBeTransferred` cache, only if it still has a caller | §5 note (`7fe7f0f0d2`) | resolved_manual_merge | priority check 4.4: Oslo deleted `TeiDashboardMenu.kt`, the cache's only known caller. Priority check 4.4: the cache is still needed, because Oslo's `TEIDataFragment` still calls `checkIfTeiCanBeTransferred()` in composition. Oslo moved the menu into the view model (`moreOptionsMenu`, built in `io`). `checkIfTeiCanBeTransferred()` was restored to Oslo's repository call: using the cache there would race, since `dashboardModel` is emitted before the cache is filled and the cache is not part of the `combine`, so 'Transfer' could be missing. The cache is now consumed only by `TEIDataFragment` via `teiCanBeTransferredState`. Update the §5 note in 9.1 |
| `app/src/main/java/org/dhis2/usescases/searchTrackEntity/SearchRepositoryImplKt.kt` | manual_reapply_on_theirs | `searchTeiModel.addToAllAttributes(...)` block that keeps every attribute for search cards | §2.10 | resolved_manual_merge | **inventory gap**: has an `// EyeSeeTea customization` comment but isn't in `customization-files.md`. Oslo only reformatted the hunk with ktlint. `transformedValue` stays hoisted out of the `if`, in Oslo's brace format |
| `app/src/main/java/org/dhis2/usescases/teiDashboard/dashboardfragments/teidata/TEIDataModule.kt` | manual_reapply_on_theirs | Dagger wiring: `BasicPreferenceProvider`, `ResourceManager`, `OrgUnitRepository` (`OrgUnitD2Repository`), `lastBiometricsSearchSessionId` into `TEIDataPresenter` | §2.7 / §2.10 / §2.13 / §2.14 (presenter wiring) | resolved_manual_merge | **inventory gap**: wiring file for `TEIDataPresenter` customizations isn't listed. The rest of the fork's diff is ktlint reformatting; take Oslo's format. Oslo's args plus our 4; `provideQuickActionMapper` is Oslo's (`customLabelProvider`). Cleaned inherited noise: 2 unused imports, 4 reformatted one-liners, 2 missing trailing commas. The diff is now only Simprints wiring (+19 lines), including the `basicPreferenceProvider` passed to `TeiDataRepositoryImpl` |
| `form/src/main/java/org/dhis2/form/ui/FormViewModel.kt` | manual_reapply_on_theirs | `onFieldsLoadingListener` / `onFieldsLoadedListener` hooks applied before `formSectionMapper.mapFromFieldUiModelList` | §2.10 | resolved_manual_merge | priority check 4.5. B6 `DROP_OLDEST` stays (Oslo's). Oslo only reformatted `items` (ktlint); hooks kept in Oslo's chained format. `977c1c439` (`isRepeatableIntent` adds `OnSection`) doesn't touch the biometric save intents |
| `app/src/test/java/org/dhis2/usescases/searchTrackEntity/SearchRepositoryTest.kt` | manual_reapply_on_theirs | `basicPreferenceProvider` mock passed to the repository | test wiring for §2.x | resolved_keep_ours | |
| `app/src/test/java/org/dhis2/usescases/searchTrackEntity/ui/mapper/TEICardMapperTest.kt` | manual_reapply_on_theirs | 3 confirmation-dialog-title tests | §2.9 | resolved_manual_merge | **inventory gap** (test file). Kept Oslo's `customLabelProvider` and follow-up stub, plus our biometrics-mode prefs mocks and 3 tests. Dropped the obsolete `marked_follow_up` resource stub. The diff is insertions only (+112) |
| `app/src/androidTest/java/org/dhis2/usescases/teidashboard/TeiDashboardMobileActivityTest.kt` | accept_theirs (reclassified) | none | n/a | resolved_keep_theirs | the fork diff was merge noise only: an unused `BasicPreferenceProvider` import and a dropped trailing comma (from `f81f1dc3f`, WIDP 3.3.0). Oslo replaced `featureConfigRepository` with `customLabelProvider` in the `DashboardRepositoryImpl` constructor |
| `gradle/libs.versions.toml` | defer_after_build_verification | Oslo versions plus `vName = "3.5.0-simprints-fork-1"`; `vCode` 159 | §4 shared drift | resolved_manual_merge | resolved by the user in the IDE: vCode 159, vName `3.5.0-simprints-fork-1`. Build check still pending (6.1). `gradle` 9.3.1, `kotlin` 2.4.10, `dhis2sdk` 1.15.0-eyeseetea-fork-1 come from baseline |
| `eyeseetea-docs/templates/openspec-config.yaml.template` | accept_ours | keep the 2 test-quality rules that baseline hasn't promoted yet (B7) | n/a (B7) | resolved_keep_ours | baseline added the other 2 rules in `3cd19be2e`; the conflict is only the 2 missing ones |
| Automerged §2 files: `EnrollmentPresenterImpl.kt`, `EnrollmentPresenterImplTest.kt`, `TEIDataPresenter.kt`, `TEICardMapper.kt`, `DashboardProgramModel.kt`, `TeiDashboardMobileActivity.kt`, `FormView.kt`, `LoginActivity.kt`, `ProgramViewModel.kt`, `SearchJavaToCompose.kt`, `SearchTEPresenter.java`, `SearchTEActivity.kt`, `tracker/.../SearchTrackedEntities.kt` | automerged, needs verification | customization lines present | §2.2–§2.5, §2.7, §2.9, §2.10, §2.13, §2.14 | needs_validation | changed by baseline, no conflict. Section 7 automerge verification plus priority checks 4.1 (labels), 4.3 (`LoginActivity`), 4.5 (`FormView`) |
| §3 files: `OpenIdSession.kt`, `SyncStatusDialog.kt`, `SyncPresenterImpl.kt` (deleted by Oslo) | accept_theirs | none | out of scope | resolved_keep_theirs | automerged. No fork drift against baseline and no `biometric`/`simprints` match in the fork's version |
| `app/build.gradle.kts` (§4) | defer_after_build_verification | `simprints` flavor block kept | §4 shared drift | needs_validation | automerged; verify in 3.4 / 6.1 |

Preclassification findings (2026-10-22):
- No `.claude/skills/openspec-*` `AA` conflicts this time: baseline didn't
  touch those files in this range. B3 is still pending but caused no conflict.
- No file deleted by Oslo in this range carried Simprints code. Every
  deleted file was grepped for `biometric|simprints|EyeSeeTea` at
  `09cad0d3e`, with zero matches.
- 2026-10-22: `DashboardViewModel.kt`, `SearchTEIViewModel.kt` and
  `SearchRepositoryImplKt.kt` (plus the OpenSpec template earlier) were found
  overwritten with the merge-base (stage 1) version and no markers,
  apparently from the IDE merge tool. Restored with `git checkout -m`. Don't
  open conflicted files in the IDE merge tool while resolving here.
- 3 inventory gaps for `customization-files.md` (fix in 9.1):
  `SearchRepositoryImplKt.kt`, `TEIDataModule.kt` and `TEICardMapperTest.kt`.
  `FormViewModel.kt` is only mentioned in prose in §2.10, without a path entry.
- §2.1, §2.6, §2.11 and §2.12 have no shared file changed by baseline in
  this range.

Silent breakages found by compiling (no git conflict), 2026-10-22:

| File | Oslo change | Fix |
|------|-------------|-----|
| `usescases/biometrics/duplicates/BiometricsDuplicatesDialogModule.kt` | `customLabelProvider` added to `SearchRepositoryImplKt` / `TEICardMapper` (`206a40711`, `105beb771`); `domainErrorMapper` added to `SearchTrackedEntityRepositoryImpl` (`cf72c54d5`) | pass them through, mirroring `SearchTEModule`; module-local `DomainErrorMapper` and `D2ErrorMessageProvider` providers, as Oslo does per module |
| `usescases/biometrics/duplicates/BiometricsDuplicatesDialogPresenter.kt` | search paging emits `TrackedEntitySearchPagingItem` (`cf72c54d5`) | `Item` → `SearchTeiModel`; `Error` logged and dropped (the dialog adapter has no error row) |
| `usescases/teiDashboard/dashboardfragments/teidata/TEIDataPresenter.kt` | `DashboardRepository.getDashboardModel()` is `suspend` (`105beb771`) | `fetchDashboardModel()` uses a coroutine (`io` for the query, `ui` for state). Dropped a dead duplicate call. Added the customization comment |
| `usescases/login/LoginRepository.kt` | raw `testing_credentials` / `training_credentials` deleted (`8f2855d70`) | file deleted. It was dead code that Oslo removed in `e72372338`, resurrected by an old fork merge (`750792ebf`) |

Design debt recorded: the duplicates dialog is a hand copy of the search wiring (see `refactors-pending.md`).

## Improvements to promote to `develop-eyeseetea`

Found during this upgrade. Promote them as a single PR against
`develop-eyeseetea` when the upgrade closes.

- **B8. ktlint failure in the baseline itself.**
  `app/src/eyeseetea/java/org/dhis2/utils/granularsync/GranularSyncModule.kt:51`
  breaks `standard:function-signature`: `provideSyncUiStateMapper`'s body fits on one line.
  Fix: join the expression onto the signature line, matching Oslo's `dhis2` copy.
- **B9. Flavor-copy drift rule for `conflict-rules.md`.** After merging Oslo
  (into baseline) or baseline (into a fork), run
  `git diff --name-status <old> <new> -- app/src/dhis2 app/src/dhis2PlayServices`
  and port each change into every flavor copy. Git never raises a conflict on
  flavor-only files. This hit `GranularSyncModule.kt` in both the baseline and
  Simprints in 3.5.0.
- **B10. Document in the upgrade runbook that Oslo's `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is
  disabled at repo level on purpose** (`gh workflow disable ci.yml`,
  2026-10-22). It fails on PR size and needs BrowserStack and Sonar secrets the
  EyeSeeTea repo doesn't have.
- **B11. Fork CI never runs ktlint.** `eyeseetea-main.yml` only runs unit tests,
  which let ~1,775 violations accumulate in Simprints code (see
  `refactors-pending.md`). Not decided: whether baseline CI should add
  `ktlintCheck`.
- **B7 (carried over).** 2 test-quality rules are still missing from the
  baseline `openspec-config.yaml.template`.

## Open Questions

- Does Oslo 3.5.0's custom terminology change any label that Simprints
  testers rely on in biometric flows? Observe it during manual validation.

## Validation Notes

- build: compiles (`testSimprintsDebugUnitTest` / `testAndroidHostTest` ran to completion, 2026-11-11).
- targeted tests (8.1, 2026-11-11, without clearing kapt/KSP caches first):
  `./gradlew testSimprintsDebugUnitTest testAndroidHostTest --continue`.
  Aggregated: 1382 run, 1378 passed, **4 failed**, all in
  `TeiDataPresenterTest` (`:app`):
  - `should_not_return_biometrics_model_if_biometrics_mode_is_zero` and
    `..._limited_and_biometrics_is_empty`: `UninitializedPropertyAccessException`
    (`lateinit trackedEntityInstance`, test line 689).
  - `Should write the biometric template attribute when register completes with
    credential and templates` and `Should return null when apply effects of hide
    program stage with no events`: `UnfinishedStubbingException` at
    `givenADashboardModel` (test line ~1655). The second one is probably
    collateral of the first (a dangling stub on a shared mock).
  **Fixed 2026-11-12.** Cause: SDK 1.15.0's `TrackedEntityAttributeValue.builder().build()` requires
  `trackedEntityInstance`, and the helper `givenADashboardModel` did not set it (the two
  `UnfinishedStubbingException` were collateral of that exception thrown inside `whenever(...)`).
  Fix: `.trackedEntityInstance(teiUid)` in the helper. Not related to `fetchDashboardModel()`.
  Re-run `testSimprintsDebugUnitTest testAndroidHostTest --continue`: 1382 run, 1382 passed.
- manual flows checked: see `upgrade-validation-checklist.md` ("Status: 3.5.0 upgrade").

## Automerge verification (task 7.1, 2026-11-11)

Method: for each path listed in `customization-files.md` (and every non-flavor
file carrying an `// EyeSeeTea customization|fix` marker), compare the set of
unique lines matching `biometric|simprints|EyeSeeTea` in `HEAD`
(`09cad0d3e`, pre-merge fork) against the working tree. A line present in
`HEAD` and absent now counts as lost. Limit: it cannot see a dropped line that
has none of those words, so the diff-scan of the heavily merged files in the
Decisions table remains the reference for those.

- 82 existing inventory files: **0 lost lines**, except `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
  (expected: `dhis2sdk` `1.14.2` → `1.15.0-eyeseetea-fork-1`, `vName` `3.4.2` → `3.5.0`).
- 21 files carry a marker but have no path entry in the inventory. **0 lost lines**
  in 20 of them. They are the inventory gaps for 9.1:
  `AppComponent.java`, `BiometricsDuplicatesDialogAdapter.kt`,
  `BiometricsDuplicatesDialogModule.kt`, `BiometricsDuplicatesDialogView.kt`,
  `BiometricsSearchConfirmationDialog.kt`, `SearchRepository.java`,
  `SearchRepositoryImplKt.kt`, `SearchTeiModel.java`, `SearchTEKoinModule.kt`,
  `TeiDataRepository.kt`, `LastSelection.kt`, `SearchTEIViewModelTest.kt`,
  `TEICardMapperTest.kt`, `PreferenceModule.kt`, `ListCardUiModel.kt`,
  `PreferenceConstants.kt`, `FormRepositoryImpl.kt`, `FormSectionMapper.kt`,
  `DateProvider.kt`, `InputsForTextValueTypeProvider.kt`, plus `settings.gradle.kts`
  (named in the inventory without a path). Several are probably covered by name in
  prose; 9.1 must give each one a path entry.
- `FormViewModel.kt`: 1 lost line, the `// EyeSeeTea fix` for ANDROAPP-7666
  (completed-event "mark as complete?" dialog). **Expected, not a casualty**:
  Oslo fixed it in 3.5.0 and `develop-eyeseetea` dropped it too (tree and baseline
  both have 0 `EyeSeeTea fix` lines there). The remaining diff against baseline is
  the `onFieldsLoadingListener` / `onFieldsLoadedListener` hooks.
- Inventory entries that do not resolve to a file (fix in 9.1):
  `app/src/main/java/org/dhis2/data/service/SyncPresenterImpl.kt` (deleted by Oslo,
  0 Simprints matches in `HEAD`),
  `app/src/simprints/java/org/dhis2/data/user/GranularSyncModule.kt` (wrong path, already
  noted in the inventory), `customizations/eyeseetea/customizations-eyeseetea.md`
  (path prose, file not in the fork) and `tracker/src/commonMain/.../SearchTrackedEntities.kt`
  (ellipsis; the real file exists and has 0 lost lines).
- Oslo-deleted or renamed files (`git diff --cached -M HEAD`, status `D`/`R`): none
  had `biometric|simprints|EyeSeeTea` in their `HEAD` version.

## Finalization

- surviving customizations moved to `customization-files.md`: `no`
- stable rules moved to `conflict-rules.md`: `no`
- temporary notes ready to archive/remove: `no`
- unexplained shared drift remaining: `unknown`
